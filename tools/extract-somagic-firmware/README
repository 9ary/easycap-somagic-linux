This is a small tool to extract the EasyCAP Somagic firmware from a Windows 
driver file. It searches for the firmware and verifies its CRC32 signature 
before writing it to a file.

Instructions:

Using Wine (preferred) or Windows, run "Setup.exe", as found in the "Drivers"
directory of the EasyCAP DC60 installation CD. This should create a file named 
"SmiUsbGrabber3C.sys", located in the 
"Program Files/Common Files/Somagic/SmiUsbGrabber3C/xp/" directory. 

Build and run extract-somagic-firmware:

make
cp ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/Common\ Files/Somagic/SmiUsbGrabber3C/xp/SmiUsbGrabber3C.sys .
sudo ./extract-somagic-firmware SmiUsbGrabber3C.sys
