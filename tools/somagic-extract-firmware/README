This is a small tool to extract the EasyCAP Somagic firmware from a Windows 
driver file. It searches the driver file for the firmware and verifies its CRC32
signature before writing it to a file.


Instructions
------------
Using Wine or Windows, run "Setup.exe", which should be found in the "Drivers"
directory of the EasyCAP installation CD. This should create a driver file named 
"SmiUsbGrabber3C.sys" or "SmiUsbGrabber3E.sys", located in the 
"Program Files/Common Files/Somagic/SmiUsbGrabber3C/xp/" or
"Program Files/Common Files/Somagic/SmiUsbGrabber3E/xp/" directory.
