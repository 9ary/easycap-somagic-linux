Description
-----------
somagic-extract-firmware is a small tool to extract the EasyCAP Somagic
firmware from a Windows driver file. It searches the driver file for the
firmware and verifies its CRC32 signature before writing it to a file.


Preliminaries
-------------
Before using this program, a file must be obtained. Using Wine or
Windows, run "Setup.exe", which should be found in the "Drivers"
directory of the EasyCAP installation CD. This should create a driver
file named "SmiUsbGrabber3C.sys" or "SmiUsbGrabber3E.sys", located in
the "Program Files/Common Files/Somagic/SmiUsbGrabber3C/xp/" or
"Program Files/Common Files/Somagic/SmiUsbGrabber3E/xp/" directory.


Dependencies
------------
make, gcc, libgcrypt11 (and development headers)


Example
-------
sudo somagic-extract-firmware ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/Common\ Files/Somagic/SmiUsbGrabber3C/xp/SmiUsbGrabber3C.sys
