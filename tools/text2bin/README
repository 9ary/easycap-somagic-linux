This is a small tool to create a binary firmware file from a text file with
hex values.

The file with the hex values must be converted to a c header file, that 
contains the following:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#define BYTECOUNT 7502

unsigned char file[] = {
0xff,0xac,0xff,0x3f,
0xff,0xaf,0x32,0x12,
[...],
0xff,0xcf,0x34
};

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The number after BYTECOUNT, must be the number of bytes in the array.

This file must be named "file.h".

Compile:
gcc text2bin.c -o text2bin

Run:
./text2bin name_of_output.bin
