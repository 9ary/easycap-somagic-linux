This is a kernel-driver for the Somagic EasyCap devices,
with the "smi2021cbe" chip.

The driver consists of two modules,
"smi2021.ko" and "smi2021_bootloader.ko",
you will probably need both for the device to work.

 * The driver will not compile on kernels older than 3.6.0.

 * You must load the "saa7115" and "uvcvideo" modules before,
   you try to load the "smi2021" module.
   You will get error messages in dmesg about missing symbols
   if you forget this.

smi2021_bootloader is responsible for the first initialization of the device,
it requires a firmware file called "smi2021_3c.bin", "smi2021_3e.bin"
or "smi2021_3f.bin".
This file must be located in your firmware folder, most likely "/lib/firmware/"

To get hold of this firmware you need the cd-rom that came with your device.

If you have several devices with differen firmware versions,
you can tell "smi2021_bootlader" what firmware to upload by using a
module parameter called "firmware_version".

example:
 sudo /sbin/insmod smi2021_bootloader firmware_version=60

This will tell the module to upload the 0x3c (Decimal 60) firmware into the first device
that is connected.

The options are:
 * 60 = 0x3c
 * 62 = 0x3e
 * 63 = 0x3f

If you intend to connect another device, you can change the module parameter like this:
 echo 62 > /sys/module/smi2021_bootloader/parameters/firmware_version

After this, the next device connected will get the 0x3f firmware.
