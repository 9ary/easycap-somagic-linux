ABOUT:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a part of a USB driver implementation for the Easycap DC60
video capture device with USB id 1c88:0007

This driver is capable of uploading a firmware for the device using the kernel
firmware API, and will register a V4L2 Driver for the device.

To use this driver you need a copy of the firmware file. Due to legal
complications, the firmware cannot be distributed with this package, but it
can be extracted from UsbSnoop logs, that you can generate when you plug
the device into a Windows machine. 

The firmware should be named "somagic_firmware.bin", and placed in
/lib/firmware

USAGE:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
make
sudo /sbin/insmod somagic.ko [video_field_order=(0|1|2)]

CHANGELOG:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12.08.2012:
I've added the ability to choose how to handle interlaced video by changing the
'video_field_order' parameter when loading the module.
This should help you get a better control on deinterlacing of interlaced frames.

The options are:

V4L2_FIELD_INTERLACED (0 - default):
This will make each frame received from the device contain
both fields interleaved line by line.

V4L2_FIELD_SEQ_TB (1):
Each frame recieved from the device will contain both fields.
Top field in the start of the frame, and the bottom field at the bottom.

V4L2_FIELD_ALTERNATE (2):
The device will deliver a full frame for each field.
That is, for PAL video, you will get 50 frames per second.
Each frame will contain just one new field, with the previous field
interleaved into the new frame.

This driver has been tested and developed under 
OpenSUSE 11.4 -> OpenSUSE 12.2 (Tumbleweed)
with at least the following kernels:
* 3.1.0-46-desktop
* 3.2.10-15-defaulti
* 3.5.0-36-default

The USBVision driver (linux/drivers/media/video/usbvision) was used as a base
in the initial development of this driver.
